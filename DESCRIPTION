Description: Produces tables for descriptive epidemiological analysis. These
    tables describe counts of variables in either line-list or survey data
    (with appropriate confidence intervals), with additional functionality to
    calculate odds, risk, and incidence rate ratios directly from a linelist
    across several variables. This package is part of the 'R4EPIs' project
    <https://R4epis.netlify.com>.
