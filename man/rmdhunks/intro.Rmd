The {epitabulate} package produces tables for descriptive epidemiological analysis.
It contains four functions:

 - `tab_linelist()` --- Tabulate and describe counts of variables in a linelist
 - `tab_survey()` --- Tabulate and describe counts of variables in a survey (with appropriate CIs)
 - `tab_univariate()` --- Calculate Odds / Risk / Incidence Rate Ratios directly from a linelist
 - `data_frame_from_2x2()` --- Creates a data frame from a 2x2 table for unambiguous interpretation

## Installation

{epitabulate} is currently under development, but you can keep up-to-date by
installing it from the R4EPIs drat repository:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("R4EPI")
install.packages("epitabulate")
```

You can also install the in-development version from GitHub using the {remotes}
package (but there's no guarantee that it will be stable):

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("R4EPI/epitabulate") 
```
